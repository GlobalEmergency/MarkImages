# Vercel Prisma Build Fix

## Problem
The application was failing to build on Vercel with the following error:
```
Error [PrismaClientInitializationError]: Prisma has detected that this project was built on Vercel, which caches dependencies. This leads to an outdated Prisma Client because Prisma's auto-generation isn't triggered.
```

## Root Cause
Vercel caches dependencies to speed up builds, but this prevents Prisma from automatically generating the client during the build process. The Prisma client needs to be explicitly generated during the build.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated package.json build script
Changed from:
```json
"build": "next build"
```
To:
```json
"build": "npx prisma generate && next build"
```

### 2. Added postinstall script
Added a postinstall script as an additional safeguard:
```json
"postinstall": "npx prisma generate"
```

### 3. Created vercel.json configuration
Created a `vercel.json` file with explicit build and install commands:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npx prisma generate && next build",
  "installCommand": "npm install"
}
```

## Verification
The build was tested locally and completed successfully:
- ✅ Prisma Client generated successfully
- ✅ Next.js build completed without errors
- ✅ All API routes compiled correctly

## How It Works
1. **During npm install**: The `postinstall` script ensures Prisma client is generated after dependencies are installed
2. **During build**: The build script explicitly runs `prisma generate` before `next build`
3. **On Vercel**: The `vercel.json` configuration ensures both install and build commands include Prisma generation

This triple-layer approach ensures the Prisma client is always available regardless of caching behavior.
